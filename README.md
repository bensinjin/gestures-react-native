## Motions and Gestures - React Native

1) Important note about environments and their differences: http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/environment. Basically you can build within the limitations of React Native's at times limited apis (good enough for this demo) or you can allow support for native code (Android/IOS) but that requires additional setup (AndroidStudio/Xcode). Projects can always be ported from native React Native projects to projects that support native development.

2) Install expo (desktop & mobile tools) https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html

3) Install Nodejs & Watchman https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html#nodejs (Optional, required for development)
